# PrimeCare batch continuation loop

Each iteration starts from current main. Inspect the declaration and its real schema/authority, implement a bounded related family, write request/response contracts and tests, regenerate the inventory, then run local fixture, TypeScript and governance checks. Publish a PR only after those checks pass. Merge only after that PR's unchanged head passes UUID/text PostgreSQL CI and security scanning. Record the merged checkpoint before starting the next iteration. An unreviewed model or action is not automatically made accessible.

## Current iteration

Batches 225–235 implement actor-authored post metadata, actor ledger-event metadata, client-profile-linked inventory metadata and purchase-order metadata. Four existing premium GET declarations are repaired through the canonical owner-scoped handlers. The explicitly registered clientProfileId owner column is quoted in PostgreSQL. Article contents, accounting details, SKU/quantity/prices and supplier/order amounts are excluded. No new grants or business writes.

Local checks: 1,613 API fixtures, five authority-preflight regression tests, Worker TypeScript and governance delta guardian pass. Dedicated disposable PostgreSQL tests are included in both identity jobs; CI/merge confirmation is pending at this checkpoint. No deployment or production database changes.

Inventory: 1,410 declared operations; 323 have local fixture evidence, 1,077 are verification pending, 10 are blocked. Pending is an evidence gap, not proof that every declaration lacks code. Before this iteration the 1,081 pending declarations comprised 818 POST actions and 263 GET reads. This iteration repairs four GET declarations while adding 11 canonical operations with local fixture coverage.

## Next iteration

Inspect the explicit patient_id relations in vital_signs and mar_entries. VitalSign has no tenant column and requires the current unique actor-owned ClientProfile tenant bridge in every record query. MAR_Entry must use patient_id, not its unrelated bare client_id, and exclude null/mismatched recorded tenants. Define only supported timestamp ordering and stored-label summaries; no medication contents or administration claims. Do not implement unreviewed writes from generated declarations.

Full completion requires the outstanding business-action contracts, authenticated UI workflow evidence and current release/migration/performance evidence. This document never promotes release gates or asserts production readiness.
